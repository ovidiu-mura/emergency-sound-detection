# CS510: sound - Emergency Sound Detection

## Summary
The Emergency Sound Detection project creates the emergency signal using frequency modulation and store the it in a wav file; then the emergency sound is mixed with brown noise, white noise and pink noise. The brown, white and pink noise are generated by functions using math equations which describes these noises.

The mixed signals are plotted in time domain and frequency domain to show the resulted mix signal. I mixed the signals using addition, multiplication and average. I implemented covolution of the given signal with gaussian window and FFT convolution using Convolution Theorem. After the convolution, I implemented normalized and standard correlation to identify the emergency signal in the convoluted/mixed signal. 

Finally, I implemented lowpass, highpass, and bandpass filters to remove frequencies from the mixed/convoluted signals using the Butter filter which returns the filtered coefficients based on the given arguments.
